            <h2>Covid Guidlines</h2>
            <ul>Here are the rules as per the CDC and our water polo insurance carrier AWP:
                <li>Indoors, including bathrooms, you must socially distance or wear a mask or both. You are encouraged to social distance OR wear a mask on deck.
                </li>
                <li>You may not wear a mask in the water. You must follow lifeguard instructions.
                </li>
                <li>Players may not share water bottles or whistles. Extra water bottles and whistles for volunteer officials will be made available, but it's recommended to bring your own water bottles.
                </li>
                <li>If you experience symptoms leading up to the event you should consult a physician, and you may not attend the event.
                </li>
                <li>Leading up to the event we also ask that you avoid high risk behavior. New Jersey and New York are currently doing well, but that can change. Attending the event is an assumption of risk. Please consult government and public health resources to stay informed.
                </li>
